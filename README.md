Hello! These are the scripts used for the paper on ice-shelf viability.

I will prepare a cleaner repository upon acceptance. In the meantime, here is the important information:

- Figure 2 was done with ``/notebooks/analysis/timeseries_nb_viable_isf_withoutGISS_withhydrofrac.ipynb`` and ``/notebooks/analysis/2D_subplots_viability_proba_withoutGISS.ipynb``
- Figure 3 was done with ``/notebooks/analysis/2D_subplots_viability_proba_withoutGISS.ipynb``
- Figure S1, S2 and S3 were done with ``/notebooks/analysis/timeseries_nb_viable_isf_withoutGISS_withhydrofrac.ipynb``
- Figure S4, S5, S6, and S7 were done with ``/notebooks/analysis/plot_mass_fluxes.ipynb``
- Figure S8 was done with ``/notebooks/analysis/timeseries_nb_viable_isf_withoutGISS_withhydrofrac.ipynb`` and ``/notebooks/analysis/2D_subplots_viability_proba_withoutGISS-Copy1.ipynb``
